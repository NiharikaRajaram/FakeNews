The Defense Readiness Condition, also known as DEFCON, is an alert system used by the United States Armed Forces The system analyzes threats to the United States and prescribes five states of alert, ranging from DEFCON 5 – least severe – to DEFCON 1 – most severe

The highest ever DEFCON alert announced was level 2, which was in place for a month during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 In June 2016, in response to rising tensions between Russia and America, the Armed Forces of the United States were allegedly ordered to up the DEFCON alert from level 4 to level 3 DEFCON 3 means that, while there are ‘no imminent nuclear threats’, ‘the situation is considered fluid’ and the air force should be prepared to mobilize in 15 minutes The DEFCON level has since changed back to 4, but seeing as this is the same level that was set following the 2001 September 11 attacks, it isn’t all that reassuring NUMBER 9: MILITARY ANNOUNCEMENTS In a terrifying move, officials from the Pentagon have admitted that they see World War Three as basically imminent


 
Major General William Hix announced in October 2016 that the United States army was getting ready for violence on a previously unseen scale According to Hix, the war will be ‘extremely lethal and fast, and we will not own the stopwatch’ Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter also argued that the way in which the army approaches conflict needs to change, because ‘today’s security environment is dramatically different than the one we’ve been engaged in for the last 25 years’ The US military is therefore moving its focus away from studying the tactics of insurgent and irregular forces, such as the Taliban in Afghanistan Instead, its officers are considering all-out combat with ‘high-end enemies’ like Russia or China

10 Ways America Is Preparing For World War Three NUMBER 10: DEFCON ALERT SYSTEM The Defense Readiness Condition, also known as DEFCON, is an alert system used by the United States Armed Forces The system analyzes threats to the United States and prescribes five states of alert, ranging from DEFCON 5 – least severe – to DEFCON 1 – most severe The highest ever DEFCON alert announced was level 2, which was in place for a month during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 In June 2016, in response to rising tensions between Russia and America, the Armed Forces of the United States were allegedly ordered to up the DEFCON alert from level 4 to level 3 DEFCON 3 means that, while there are ‘no imminent nuclear threats’, ‘the situation is considered fluid’ and the air force should be prepared to mobilize in 15 minutes

The DEFCON level has since changed back to 4, but seeing as this is the same level that was set following the 2001 September 11 attacks, it isn’t all that reassuring NUMBER 9: MILITARY ANNOUNCEMENTS In a terrifying move, officials from the Pentagon have admitted that they see World War Three as basically imminent Major General William Hix announced in October 2016 that the United States army was getting ready for violence on a previously unseen scale According to Hix, the war will be ‘extremely lethal and fast, and we will not own the stopwatch’ Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter also argued that the way in which the army approaches conflict needs to change, because ‘today’s security environment is dramatically different than the one we’ve been engaged in for the last 25 years’

The US military is therefore moving its focus away from studying the tactics of insurgent and irregular forces, such as the Taliban in Afghanistan Instead, its officers are considering all-out combat with ‘high-end enemies’ like Russia or China NUMBER 8: THE RUSSIAN NEW GENERATION WARFARE STUDY Lieutenant General H R McMaster, director of the US Army’s Capabilities Integration Center, is a highly decorated former soldier with a reputation for sound strategic understanding

He has been assigned to conduct a study analyzing Russia’s military capabilities, in order to prepare America for a battle against the nation McMaster studied how Russia conducted land warfare during the Russia/Ukraine conflict in 2014, following the controversial annexation of Crimea by Russia Speaking at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC, he said that he believed the Russians have superior artillery firepower, sophisticated land warfare tactics, and better combat vehicles than the Americans He highlighted this as a major flaw in American preparation, and urged increased spending on tanks and land artillery, not just nuclear armament NUMBER 7: INCREASED MILITARY SPENDING In February 2016, the Obama administration announced a desire to increase the budget for the Department of Defense by just less than 1% before 2017

This may not sound like a great amount, but this actually equates to a whopping $22 billion increase in a single year It is also a change of tactic for the US, which has been reducing military spending over the last decade At $5963 billion, the United States defense budget is already greater than the next 7 nations combined

This increased spending is intended to fund a revamp of the army’s equipment and military vehicles, for example the introduction of 3,000 Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicles, or AMPVs, which cost $17 million each NUMBER 6: US WARSHIPS IN CHINESE WATERS The US isn’t just considering the increasing likelihood of a war breaking out with Russia – tensions between America and China are also extremely high A large source of this tension comes from China claiming territorial rights to nearly all of the waters in the South China Sea, which the UN has not recognized As a result of growing Chinese aggression over this issue, the US has been sending warships to the area since the beginning of 2016

Former Director of US National Intelligence and retired Navy admiral Dennis Blair has said that America should be prepared to use military force to back up the UN’s decision The Chinese government has responded to the presence of these deadly warships by publicly announcing that the country is more than ready to defend against provocations NUMBER 5: ANAKONDA 2016 In a clear threatening message to Russia, June 2016 saw NATO allies launch the largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War: Exercise Anakonda 2016 31,000 troops from 24 nations, including the UK, Germany, and Spain participated in the colossal exercise in Poland, although approximately 14,000 of these troops were American Anakonda 2016 took place over 10 days and included manoeuvres such as night time helicopter assaults, naval exercises, and land-based military drills

The purpose of the drill was to strengthen NATO’s multinational military alliance in eastern Europe to help deter a future attack by Russia Russia has criticized the exercise for being deliberately antagonistic, particularly as the naval exercises were performed in the waters near Kaliningrad, the very area where Russia has deployed highly controversial nuclear-ready missiles NUMBER 4: REINFORCING NATO’S EASTERN FLANK Anakonda 2016 isn’t the only way in which the US and NATO are working toward securing eastern Europe against Russian aggression The alliance is currently in the process of reinforcing the so-called ‘eastern flank’ The eastern flank is an alliance of former Soviet partners, such as Poland and the Baltic States, which are now loyal to the West but fear military assault from Moscow

At the NATO Summit in Warsaw in July 2016, it was agreed that NATO would deploy four multinational battalions along the eastern flank to discourage Russian invasion The US will supply a large proportion of the troops for these battalions The Pentagon has also announced that spending on their ‘European Reassurance Initiative’ will almost quadruple from $789 million in 2016 to £34 billion in 2017 NUMBER 3: WOMEN IN US MILITARY DRAFT As a further indication of the US's determination to prepare for a possible war, the nation’s military has been looking at ways to increase its number of troops

One suggestion for this is to start including women in the Military Selective Service Act, a proposal that has been passed by the Senate Armed Services Committee and could become law by 2018 This act has been in place since 1967 and is a registration program used by the American government to create a list of suitable individuals ready to be conscripted should war break out At the moment, all American men are required by law to sign up to the Service within 30 days of turning 18 and they remain on the list until they turn 25 If women were added to this list of potential army recruits, it could add approximately 15 million soldiers to the US armed forces NUMBER 2: ANTI-MISSILE DEFENSE COMPLEX One of the most overt ways in which America is preparing for World War Three is by constructing a gigantic anti-missile defense complex
