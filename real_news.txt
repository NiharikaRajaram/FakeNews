A US-UK trade deal "will absolutely be possible", Donald Trump has said, hours after he told The Sun Theresa May's Brexit plan could kill an agreement.
Speaking after talks at Chequers, Mr Trump said the US-UK relationship is "the highest level of special", while Mrs May said they had discussed plans for an "ambitious" trade agreement.
Mr Trump and his wife, Melania, later had tea with the Queen at Windsor.
Thousands of people have protested in London against Mr Trump's UK visit.
A large balloon, portraying the president as a baby, has been floated in Parliament Square as part of the demonstrations. 
Other protests are taking place across the UK on Friday and Saturday.
